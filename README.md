# Castia Client

**Castia Client** is a client-side utility client developed specifically for use on **CastiaMC**.  
Its goal is to provide **server-approved quality-of-life and visual enhancements** while strictly avoiding any unfair gameplay advantages.

Castia Client focuses on features that improve visibility, usability, and the overall player experience **without modifying combat, movement, or network behavior**.

## 🎯 Purpose

Castia Client exists to:
- Improve client-side visuals and accessibility
- Offer convenience features commonly allowed on multiplayer servers
- Maintain full compliance with CastiaMC’s rules and expectations
- Be transparent, auditable, and open-source

This client is **not** intended to bypass server restrictions or provide competitive advantages.

## ✅ Allowed Feature Philosophy

Castia Client **only includes features that are explicitly allowed** on CastiaMC or are commonly considered safe on multiplayer servers.

Included features are strictly limited to:
- Client-side rendering and visual changes
- HUD and informational overlays
- Accessibility and usability improvements

Castia Client **does not include**:
- Combat automation
- Movement manipulation
- Packet modification or spoofing
- Reach, velocity, or hitbox changes
- Any form of player or entity targeting

If a feature affects **only what the player sees** and not **what the server receives**, it aligns with the project’s philosophy.
